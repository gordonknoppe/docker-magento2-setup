# Magento 2 Setup Docker Image

A simple PHP container which executes the Magento 2 command-line install tool.

See magento2-install.sh for environment variables available for you to 
configure during runtime.

For an example of this image in action with docker-compose see https://github.com/gordonknoppe/docker-magento2-example
